  In case you're dying to know me, here ya go.
  <div class="exp">
    I'm a simple man. I enjoy burritos, movies, books and technology. Professionally, I'm a dynamic and accomplished engineer with proven ability to develop and architect highly-available and concurrent distributed systems in autonomous work environments. Voracious reader and autodidact with a passion for learning new technologies, methods, and tools with proven ability to mentor junior hires and contribute business driven decisions on tech stack and emerging technologies. Outside of work you can find me at home maintaining my own stack in my Homelab, watching movies or spending time with family. Some nights I can even steal enough time to grab a burrito. In 2017 I graduated from University of Minnesota Duluth where I studied Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Linguistics. I went on to Best Buy working on their recommendations engine. I currently work at Optum Technology integrating emgering technologies for their Product Engineering & Data Solutions team.
