    <h3>About me.</h3>

    <p class="text">
        I'm a simple man. I enjoy burritos, cooking, movies, books, technology. Professionally, I'm a dynamic and accomplished engineer with proven ability to develop and architect highly-available and concurrent distributed systems in autonomous work environments. Voracious reader and autodidact with a passion for learning new technologies, methods, and tools with proven ability to mentor junior hires and contribute business driven decisions on tech stack and emerging technologies. 
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        Outside of work you can find me at home maintaining my own stack in my Homelab, watching movies or spending time with family. Some nights I can even steal enough time to grab a burrito. In 2017 I graduated from <a class="web-links" href="https://d.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota Duluth</a> where I studied Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Linguistics. I went on to <a class="web-links" href="https://twitter.com/BestBuy">@BestBuy</a> working on their recommendations engine. I currently work at <a class="web-links" href="https://twitter.com/Optum">@Optum</a> integrating emgering technologies for their Product Engineering & Data Solutions team.
