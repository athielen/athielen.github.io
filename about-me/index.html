    <h3>About me.</h3>

    <p>
        I'm a simple man. I enjoy burritos, cooking, movies, books, technology. Professionally, I'm a dynamic and accomplished engineer with proven ability to develop and architect highly-available and concurrent distributed systems in autonomous work environments. Voracious reader and autodidact with a passion for learning new technologies, methods, and tools with proven ability to mentor junior hires and contribute business driven decisions on tech stack and emerging technologies.

    <p>
        Outside of work you can find me at home maintaining my own stack in my Homelab, watching movies or spending time with family. Some nights I can even steal enough time to grab a burrito. In 2017 I graduated from University of Minnesota Duluth where I studied Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Linguistics. I went on to Best Buy working on their recommendations engine. I currently work at Optum Technology integrating emgering technologies for their Product Engineering & Data Solutions team.
