Some seasons of your life are very fruitful in growth. Others are not. In those seasons it's all on you to learn and grow. Here are some ideas I try to stick to.

### 1. Practice, Practice Practice

-- Hit the leetcode and hackerrank problems. **Yes, it sucks**. Do it.

-- Read books on the latest technologies (as of writing this that would be Google Cloud Platform, Kafka Streams, Serverless Functions, Kubes, Docker) to understand different paradigms and perspectives. 

-- Read about old technology and past best practices to understand why they aren't best practices anymore

-- Start building small contrived applications for any technology.

-- Do anything!

### 2. Investment time into making your learning frictionless

There is a long history of failed attempts on my part to self direct my learning and complete personal projects. You get that initial burst of motivation but then you hit the first patch of friction... and it all falls apart.

Being the lazy engineer that I am, I don't like friction. So I sought out ways to make **frictionless development**. It's not an original idea or anything new. But with that mindset I started automating everything I could or using frameworks heavily.

**Ideas for frictionless development**:

-- Use Springboot for java web development

-- Rely heavily on archetypes for java apps

-- Use docker and templated virtualization solutions when possible

-- Build out a commons code repo of generic code

-- Create example self-opinioned projects of generic applications to use as templates

-- Automate any data entry or ETL jobs you do manually (I have scripts that handle video transcoding for videos I place in a folder, I have scripts that download my favorite youtube subscriptions and places them in it's respective NAS share)

-- Think platform development so you have a base to build off of for the next project

### 3. Build out a homelab

It's just cool and gets you some *1337* street cred.

### 4. At first lean towards the passion project

Only at first. I speak from experience and what works for me. If you're going to invest your own personal time into something, make sure it makes you happy, aligns with your passions and your values. I've tried to force myself to learn something I didn't want to (*frontend*) and I'd hit a wall very quickly regardless of future career prospects.

Go where you're passionate.

### 5. Set up an internal wiki and git repository

I use [Atlassian's Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence).

*Reader: But Tony.... that costs money. Surely you can find an opensource alternative.*

I've tried several open source wikis but I always keep coming back to Confluence. My current and past employers have used Atlassian tools so I'm very adapat at making each page look exactly like I want. It also leaves the door open for me to get a Jira license (rather than Trello) to keep track of my life.

Plus... it's only $10 bucks!

### 6. Practice, Practice, Practice  

If you say you're a programmer, PROGRAM!
