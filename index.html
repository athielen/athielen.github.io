          I am a senior software engineer and freelance photographer. I work on backends employing microservice architecture and streaming tech. I'm currently working with <a class="web-links" href="https://twitter.com/branch">@Branch</a>'s Platform Engineering Team building a platform to help companies accelerate payments and empower working Americans with accessible, fee-free, inclusive and transparent financial products.

          Depending on how you know me, I'm a Senior Engineer at <a class="web-links" href="https://twitter.com/branch">@Branch</a> (formerly <a class="web-links" href="https://twitter.com/BestBuy">@BestBuy</a>, <a class="web-links" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/optum">@Optum</a>), consult out of <a class="web-links" href="http://rebelsolutions.io">@RebelSolutions</a>, shoot photos through <a class="web-links" href="http://studio.anthonythielen.com">@Tony_from_MN</a>, run the ecomm store <a class="web-links" href="http://moisthaus.com">@MoistHaus</a>.

			   Occasionally I write a post on <a class="web-links" href="https://blog.anthonythielen.com/">@TheCapriciousEngineer</a> and add cooking recipes to <a class="web-links" httpsref="https://recipes.anthonythielen.com/">@TechsMarthaStewart</a>. On a more personal note, I've seen Dirty Dancing more times than A New Hope and listen to Call Me Maybe unironically.

          I am a little bit obsessed with automating workflows, finding effeciencies in the SDLC and making code readable. That involves a lot of refactoring, which I enjoy. A lot! On a more personal note, I've seen Dirty Dancing more times than A New Hope and listen to Call Me Maybe unironically.
