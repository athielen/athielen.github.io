          I am a developer, architect and amateur chef. I mostly work on backends employing microservice architecture and streaming tech. On the chef front, my Mom says I make "pretty good" barbacoa.

          I am a little bit obsessed with automating workflows, finding effeciencies in the SDLC and making code readable. That involves a lot of refactoring, which I enjoy. A lot!

          Currenlty, I run <a class="web-links" href="rebelsolutions.io">Rebel Solutions & Consulting</a> helping out companies in Minneapolis. Sometimes I write something <a class="web-links" href="https://athielen.com/posts/">here</a> mostly to prove to myself I learned something from yesterday.
