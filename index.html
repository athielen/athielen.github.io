        I am a software engineer, systems architect and an amateur chef. I mostly work on web backends employing Microservices with Spring Boot and Kafka Streams. On the chef front, I'm above average at making barbacoa.

        I am a little bit obsessed with automating workflows, finding effeciencies in every aspect of the SDLC and making code readable so that it's easier to evolve. That involves a lot of refactoring, which I enjoy. A lot!
