        I am a software engineer, systems architect and an amateur chef. I mostly work on web backends with Spring Boot and Kafka Streams.

        <p>Currently I work at <a class="web-links" href="https://twitter.com/Optum">@Optum</a> integrating emgering technologies for the Product Engineering & Data Solutions team. Previously I worked at <a class="web-links" href="https://twitter.com/BestBuy">@BestBuy</a> on their recommendations engine.

        I am a little bit obsessed with automating workflows, and making code readable so that it's easier to change. That involves a lot of refactoring, which I enjoy. A lot!
